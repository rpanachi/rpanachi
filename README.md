Hi, my name is <b>Rodrigo Panachi</b>. I’ve been passionate about coding since the early 2000s. After earning my degree as a <b>Computer Scientist</b>, I turned that passion into a career, and I’ve been working as a software engineer for the last two decades.

I’m all about <b>keeping things simple</b> and <b>solving problems</b> in the most efficient way possible. I’ve worked across a bunch of different industries: payments, e-commerce, health, logistics, education, you name it. This has given me a wide-ranging perspective and a solid foundation in various tech environments.

I’ve dabbled in a lot of programming languages along the way, like <b>Ruby</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>Go</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>Elixir</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>PHP</b>, whatever gets the job done. Pragmatism is my motto: keep things simple, ship as fast as possible, and get feedback; build the minimum piece of software that works well and meets real needs.

When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me tinkering with electronics, diving into <b>DIY projects</b>, or automating my home. I love experimenting with the <b>Arduino/ESP32</b>, artificial intelligence, and [3D printing]({{site.links.printables}}). It’s a fun way to keep learning and stay curious.
